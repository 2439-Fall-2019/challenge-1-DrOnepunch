Justification or Reason for the Project: 
So the MCC sage Bistro has a mobile app that they can use so they can expand their buisness across the web 
 
Main Project Deliverables: 
We will have 4 pages one for a survey one for a menu one for reservations one for Map/location  
we will use metros state of the art computers to make a very cool website for the MCC sage Bistro. The computers will allow us to code and manipulate our code. So that we can build a seriously Beautiful website that is user friendly and anyone will be able to use it 
Critical Technologies: 
Notepad++  
Vscode 
Github 
Github desktop  
Note book  
Pencil 
 
Potential Risks: 
No One would use the website and the school would lose money. Or we don’t meet deadlines and get our deal with the MCC Sage bistro. Loose trust with that department. We could also fail to impress them, and they could throw out our work (not real) 
 
Scope and Success Definitions: 
We will have 4 pages. There will be a dedicated page for google maps/location so people would be able to find the bistro. There will be a dedicated page for a menu so customers will be able to figure out what they want to eat. There will be a dedicated page for reservations so people will be able to make plans. Due to the lack of research in our industry we will have to use a embedded phone number to make reservations. We will also have a survey page so that the customers can rate how the Bistro was so the Students will know how to improve allowing for a dynamic learning experience. We will have this website done by October 13th, 2019. We are plaining to spend around $500-$600 on this project (not real) overall this goal is attainable if we work on this project methodically. We also are aiming for a user-friendly experience so anyone can use the website.

 1Test
 they visited survey first then they went to map and played arround with the Geolocation then made their way to the resurvation looked over it then mov3ed on to the menu and read over the menu lastly they hit the email button closed out hit home and when back to my student website. skiped over the survey pretty quickly after skimming it. then i had my dad go ahead and find the reservations Phone number he clicked over on resurvations and hit the number then it dialed. he found it withing 20-30 seconds he wasnt fusterated at all. My dad said he would just add some color to the background other than that he said it was a good looking/ functional website
 
 2test They visited menu read over it for a moment then made their way to the reservations read over it and then made their way over to the survey. My mom played with it for a moment and used all the scroll down menus then she made their way over to the map and played arround with the geolocation for a moment. my mom skipped over the menu pretty quickly she played arround with the survey for a moment. she spent the most time on the geolocation page. i had my mom find how to email me and she found it extemely fast on every page. she found it within 5-10 seconds. my mom sugested that i add some flair to the page but she said other than that its a realy cool website thats functional. she also mentioned that the geolocation was very cool.
 
 results very functional how ever bland.
